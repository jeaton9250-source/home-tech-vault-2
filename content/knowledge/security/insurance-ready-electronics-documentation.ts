    "Build a claim-ready packet of photos, serials, receipts, and values before you ever need an adjuster. Most homes only feel the gap when something breaks, goes missing, or a stranger on the phone asks for details nobody wrote down.",
    "You will leave with a practical way to handle this that fits a real household — short enough to keep, specific enough to use under stress.",
    "We will cover what to write down, where it should live, who can see it, and how to keep it current as gear and people change.",
    "Home Tech Vault is useful here because devices, documents, warranties, and household sharing can live in one place — so this stays a living habit instead of a weekend project that quietly expires."
